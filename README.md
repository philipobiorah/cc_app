| An ALC 3.0 #7DaysofCode Challenge Project for Google Africa Challenge Scholarship: Mobile Web Specialist Track by Philip Obiorah 

Project name: Currency Converter [ published at https://philipobiorah.github.io/cc_app/ ]

The project takes advantage of the functionalities Freecurrencyconverterapi provides. 
- Freecurrencyconverterapi is an API that converts one currency to another and returns result in json format.

The application implements the following:
                      - Service Worker
                      - Cache API
                      - IndexedDB


Limits of the Free API:   Number of Requests per Hour: 100


Application Functions:
   1.  Users can select currencies to be converted from and to
   2.  The application  can convert currencies while the application is online or offline
   
NOTA BENE: The application works 100% offline with a few selection of currencies that would allow for 100 requests per hour
using the Free Currency Converter API. (https://free.currencyconverterapi.com/)
